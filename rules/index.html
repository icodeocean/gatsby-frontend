      <h1>Rules</h1>
      <p>
        Since the Fairfield Programming Association is such a large and complex
        beast, there are many rules that keep us running smoothly. These rules
        govern how our delegates meet, when our competitions are held, what
        questions can be used for testing, how the competitors must act, etc. To
        view the 2021-2022 edition of the rulebook, follow the link below to the
        PDF. This PDF will be availble for your viewing at any FPA competition
        but is subject to change throughout the year, so look here for new
        updates.
