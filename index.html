      <p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
      <p>
        Have you ever thought about creating a coding competition between
        schools? You may not have, but if you now are thinking this, I welcome
        you to continue reading. I am attempting to build a league of schools to
        host competitions testing merit in programming. It will be known as the
        Fairfield Programming Association (FPA). To create this organization, I
        only need a few things: support from your institution, two student
        delegates from your institution, and your help maintaining the
        cohesiveness of the FPA during its adolescent years. These first two
        years are likely going to be the most challenging for this new
        organization, and the FPA will be tested at its very foundation. That is
        why I need your help, and I have outlined what you can do below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, your institution needs to support the FPA. This is not in any
        financial sense, but rather in a mutually beneficial partnership. The
        FPA’s competitions would allow your students to create connections with
        students in other schools and it would give them the opportunity to
        thrive in a competitive environment- all while learning. All your
        institution would need to support the FPA is the commitment to hosting
        at least one competition each year. The logistics of these competitions
        are outlined in the below document.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will need to elect two student delegates from your institution to
        help host the competitions. These delegates will be responsible for
        meeting in a committee with the other FPA delegates before each
        competition to design them so they are fair, challenging, and most
        importantly, fun. The logistics of the delegates and committee meetings
        will be outline in the below document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, your job will be to listen for any communications that the FPA
        sends out, and corral your students into teams for each competition. It
        is expected that every institution attends at least two other
        competitions, but that information, again, is outlined in the below
        document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Best Regards, <br />
