        "biography": "William McGonagle is one of the co-founders of the FPA. Born on September 8th, 2004, he currently resides in Bridgeport, Connecticut near the headquarters of the FPA. After seeing how income disparity contributes to a shortage of education, he decided that there needed to be more opportunities for learning. He had discussed the problem with a friend, Neil Chaudhari, and within a few weeks, the two were working on building the FPA.",
