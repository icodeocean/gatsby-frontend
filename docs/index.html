You may not have, but if you now are thinking this, I welcome you to continue reading. I am attempting to build a league of schools to host competitions testing merit in programming. It will be known as the Fairfield Programming Association (FPA). To create this organization, I only need a few things: support from your institution, two student delegates from your institution, and your help maintaining the cohesiveness of the FPA during its adolescent years. These first two years are likely going to be the most challenging for this new organization, and the FPA will be tested at its very foundation. That is why I need your help, and I have outlined what you can do below. </p> <p> Firstly, your institution needs to support the FPA. This is not in any financial sense, but rather in a mutually beneficial partnership. The FPA’s competitions would allow your students to create connections with students in other schools and it would give them the opportunity to thrive in a competitive environment- all while learning. All your institution would need to support the FPA is the commitment to hosting at least one competition each year. The logistics of these competitions are outlined in the below document. </p> <p> You will need to elect two student delegates from your institution to help host the competitions. These delegates will be responsible for meeting in a committee with the other FPA delegates before each competition to design them so they are fair, challenging, and most importantly, fun. The logistics of the delegates and committee meetings will be outline in the below document. </p> <p> Finally, your job will be to listen for any communications that the FPA sends out, and corral your students into teams for each competition. It is expected that every institution attends at least two other competitions, but that information, again, is outlined in the below document. </p> <p> Best Regards, <br> William McGonagle </p> <img width="200px" src="/signature.73077192.png" alt=""> </main> <footer>Copyright © 2021 Fairfield Programming Association</footer> </body></html>
