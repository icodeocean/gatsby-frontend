            <h2>Neil Chaudhari</h2>
            <p>
              As a co-founder of the Fairfield Programming Association, Neil
              Chaudhari has a deep love of computers and how people learn. From
              a young age, Neil picked up the Python programming language in his
              own academic pursuits. These pursuits led him into physical
              engineering and later into competitive programming, where he
              earned numerous distinctions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, as the President and Chief Operating Officer, Neil
              oversees the growth of the FPA into new areas. His main focus on a
              day-to-day basis is in-person learning programs that the FPA can
              enact in order to make measurable change.

            <h2>William McGonagle</h2>
            <p>
              As a co-founder of the Fairfield Programming Association, William
              McGonagle has always been interested about democratizing
              education. At age seven, William learned how to program by
              feigning illness and staying home from school one day, and since
              then, he has always had a love of computing. After the death of
              his father, he had a realization on the shortness of life, and
              began the creation of the Fairfield Programming Association.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, as Chief Executive Officer, he oversees general
              activity of the FPA, including a broad overview of projects,
              outreach to our corporate partners, and press campaigns.
