            We offer an array of different programs that can be split into
            different categories: growth, development, and change. Our growth
            programs are mostly events like our coding competitions and
            programming help website that attract new members to the FPA. Our
            development programs are designed to help the community such as our
            learning resources and hour of code events. Finally, our change
            programs try to mold the future of programming such as our
            open-source specifications and aptitude exams.

            <p>
              Many people do not have wide access to computers or devices to
              access our digital content. It is our mission to teach those who
              may not have access to learning devices, how to code.

            <p>
              Our coding competitions are a collaborative effort between all of
              the highschools in the Fairfield County area. They are run by
              students, and we hope to expand to the wider Northeast soon.
