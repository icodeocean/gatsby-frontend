            We offer programming competitions between private schools in the
            local Fairfield, Connecticut area. We are rapidly expanding to other
            highschool and college areas including New York, Massachusets, and
            Rhode Island.

            <p>
              Each league inside of the Fairfield Programming Association allows
              for open competition. This means that every school is given the
              opportunity to compete, as long as they are within the age limit
              and qualify under all of the rules.

            <h2>Ambassador Meetings</h2>
            <p>
              The Fairfield Programming Association holds meetings with two
              ambassadors from each school. The meetings are held in order to
              organize competitions, certify results, and create new rules. Each
              ambassador must be elected from their school to participate but
              there are no other requirements.
