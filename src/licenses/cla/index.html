          <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">
            The FPA General Code License was originally created as a way to
            permissively license our software for all without having to deal
            with commercial entities 'asset-ripping' code from our open
            projects.

            <h2>What does the license allow?</h2>
            <p>
              The license allows for anyone to use, copy, modify, merge,
              publish, or distribute the code in an educational or personal
              context. In a commercial context, users must substantially modify
              the code- prohibiting companies from copying code and selling it
              as their own on stores.

              Yes! The license is designed so that copyright owners can input
              different conditions that software users must fulfill. But, we do
              recommend that you have a lawyer look at the document before use
              as we do not claim any legal responsibility.

            <h2>Does it protect me?</h2>
            <p>
              The license includes a clause from the MIT license that protects
              the copyright owners by limiting liability and stating that the
              software is provided without warranty. This clause will limit
              liability as long as it is kept unmodified.
