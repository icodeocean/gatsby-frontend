The new Fairfield Programming Association website is built in Gatsby and uses Tailwind CSS for the styling. This enables us to keep down server costs while also providing an excellent user and developer experience. All of our pages are DSG ([Deferred Static Generation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/rendering-options/using-deferred-static-generation/)), which means that most of the information on the website can be changed by modifying the information inside of the data folder. 

## Features

### Team Member System - [Example](https://about.fairfieldprogramming.org/team/william-mcgonagle)

Every volunteer on the FPA Team has their own individual pages. This means that if you want to volunteer, you get a miniture resume explaining what you have done for the FPA, and how it has impacted others around you. Our hope is that these personal pages can help you in the future by showing how much you have helped us on our mission.
