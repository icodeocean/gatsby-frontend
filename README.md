## Features
Right now, we are more focused on getting the backend functionality of the website going before we work too much on the frontend. To see more information about the backend of the website, you can check out [this repository](https://github.com/fairfield-programming/backend-server). If you are interested in this project at all, or just want to support us, make sure you star both this repository and the backend repository. 

## Contribute

If you simply star the repo, this helps us out tremendiously. Past that, if you share this repo with your friends, that helps a lot too. If you are feeling super generous, then you can find some issues that you have with the website and try to help us with them.
